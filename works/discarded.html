<h2>
DISCARDED was created as an exploration of the topic of uniqueness and attribution in digital sound art. DISCARDED is available on a SD memory card and only one copy is made.

The content of the memory card is unique, at least at the very beginning when it is the only copy in existence. The source files are deleted and measures are taken so the content remains unique.

DISCARDED uses a CC0 license, effectively becoming public domain. The sound file can be modified, distributed and used in any way imaginable. As the content of the memory card is the "last copy", the future of the work lies in the owner's hands.

DISCARDED was made available as part of the <a href="http://www.gradbeograd.eu/article_program.php?id=1239" title="Without Reserve" target="_blank">"Without Reserve"</a> auction on February 16th 2015.</h2>
