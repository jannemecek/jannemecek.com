    Jan Nemeček emerged in the early '00s as one of the most versatile and prolific electronic producers going. In Serbia, he's been known for many years as a most interesting young electronic music talent and a staple of the local clubland. After growing up fascinated by early prog rock and "kosmische" music, Jan experimented with his own longform ambient recordings and tape loop experiments. His first break was doing sound design for sough after hardware synthesizers such as Hartmann Neuron. Late '00s saw him creating various forms of electronic music with focus on ambient and improvisatory electronic music.
