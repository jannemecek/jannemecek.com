Surreal sounds and dark emptiness of space is what describes Jan
Nemecek&rsquo;s ambient epic &ldquo;Through The Planetary
Void&rdquo;. It was concieved as a soundtrack to a complete ambient
journey. Beginning with a reflection of pure, simple frequency across
the galaxy while travelling through lush soundscape of unheard sounds,
&ldquo;Through The Planetary Void&rdquo; manages to evoke
sounds from an alien planet, visions of vast space only surpassed by
the unknown of the &ldquo;Planetary Void&rdquo;.<br />

            <br />

This project was originally recorded as an hour-long voyage into space,
using instruments that we can only associate with something familiar,
even earthly, while contrasting the eerie sounds from space never heard
by any human. &ldquo;Through The Planetary Void&rdquo; manages
to encompass a plethora of genres &ndash; from unearthly beautiful
textures, world percussion and sounds to the rawness of dark ambience.<br />

            <br />

Clocking in at just under hour, &ldquo;Planetary Void&rdquo;
takes you on an excursion into unknown and unexplored depths of space,
strange planets and evokes imagery of alien dawns, all that
&ldquo;outside the known universe&rdquo;.<br />

            <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Tahoma" size="1">Jan Nemeček was born in Belgrade, Serbia where he resides today. He
started playing piano at the early age and had his first live
appearance at the age of ten making the soundtrack for the children TV
series, later broadcasted on the most popular TV in the country. His
affection for electronic music was developed when he was introduced to
an vintage drum machine and the tape recorder which was used to
experiment with various recording techniques</p>

            
            <p>Later,
Jan moved on with music and started using MIDI sequencers that were
available at the time. With the appearance of software instruments and
computer audio recordings, he started mixing and recording all his
projects into the computer. At the moment, all of his projects are
recorded in his expanding project studio. He recently completed a
musical project where he collaborated with various well-known Serbian
musicians. Besides that, Jan is also doing various other projects like
commercials, soundtracks, etc.</p>

           
            <p>By
establishing contacts and relations with the similar authors outside
his home country, Jan contributed to a certain number of mutual
projects published worldwide, including his solo track featured on
&laquo;Listening Lounge - The World Finest Unsigned Artists
2004&raquo;, sponsored by world famous magazine &laquo;Computer
Music&raquo;. Besides, he collaborates with the companies worldwide
as a sound designer where he conceives his own copyrighted presets for
software and hardware synthesizers (Wusik, Hartmann, Manytone...) that
are now available as the standard factory presets. The results of his
interest in experimenting with the possibilities of natural and
synthesised sound, sampling techniques etc. and this conceptual and
musical signature is both audible and visible while listening to
&laquo;Through The Planetary Void&raquo;.</p>

            <p>While
Jan's never had an intention to make music out of pre-recorded loops
and samples, his sole interest while working with sound and his
player's technique was to create the vast, universal atmosphere, both
in intellectual and emotional way. His music struggles to open the door
of that world, which Jan intends to explore furthermore in his future
work.<br><br><br>
